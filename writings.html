            <p>Perfectly endless, perfectly still rice paddies spread out as far as he could see on both sides of the road.  During the day there would be many people working in the fields, he imagined, just as they did every day.  They would be wearing big bamboo hats shaped like the distant volcano to protect from sun and rain, and their tired backs would be bent to the still surface of the water.  Now, however, he could see no one in any direction, and he could see for miles.  This is not to say that he was alone by any stretch of the imagination.  What sounded like (and probably was) thousands of frogs sang to each other from across the paddies.  Above them was the endless wurr of the thousands of insects they were eating, including hundreds of lightning bugs, which could have illuminated the fields by themselves if they werenâ€™t being outshone yet by the moon.  There was a rustle as a cool breeze moving across the fields caused the rice stalks to bend in complicated rhythm with each other.  The continual guzzle of water draining from the field into a sophisticated concrete irrigation system told him the owners of the fields were not so bad-off monetarily, and he thought happily about that for a moment.  The sound of everything was so loud, and seemed so out of place with the perfectly still landscape on which no human life was visible.  
He figured he had about three hours of moon glow yet.  Three hours of wholly, divinely peaceful walking before his nightmare began again.
